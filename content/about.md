## Engineering For the Love of It

Isomatter Laboratories (isomatter::labs) is an initiative to build things from
the ground up, without assuming the most common practice, or the current
industry practice.

Is this the most efficient way? Absolutely not.

It does, however, give an opportunity to look at problems from a new angle, and
see if there is new life in old ideas, or a hidden gem of an idea in a wild
tangent.

The majority of the projects built by isomatter::labs are cyber-mechanical
systems, with a particular emphasis on robotics. This is unabashedly a result
of personal interest and excitement. In addition, however, there are things
like the [Anisochromatic](https://github.com/isomatter-labs/anisochromatic)
family of themes, or the [Starmacs](https://starmacs.isomatter-labs.com) Emacs
distribution.

Every design made at isomatter::labs is free, for any usage, forever.

Go out there and break some stuff.
