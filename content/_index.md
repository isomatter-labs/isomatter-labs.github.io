## The Dream

Isomatter Laboratories (Isomatter::Labs) is an initiative to bring cutting-edge robotics technology to the open-source community.

Every design made at Isomatter::Labs is free, for any usage, forever.

We provide STL files for mechanical components, schematics and gbr files for electrical components, and source code for software modules.
